# PasswordRater
This Program, accompanied with simple GUI, is designed to give a worst case estimation of the password strength, a user has chosen. The algorithm assumes data leakage of a potential database, as well as information of said leakage being at disposal to a malicious attacker. Algorithm computes the entropy of passwords given certain context.
